# Composite Hedges Nanopores

It is a demo README.md which still needs to be improved.

A package of coding algorithm for rapid readout of digital information storage in DNA, inspired by [HEDGES](https://github.com/whpress/hedges) and [composite DNA letter](https://github.com/leon-anavy/dna-fountain).

## What is needed

### MUSCLE
Please make sure that your environment has `MUSCLE`. This module can generate ensembles of high-accuracy alternative alignments. See [https://www.drive5.com/muscle/](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/) for more details and license restrictions.

After installing `MUSCLE`, make sure that it is placed in your system path.

### MMseqs2
For clustering each replica of specific DNA sequence, `MMseqs2` is needed. See [https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) for more details and license restrictions.

After installing `MMseqs2`, make sure that it is placed in your system path.
